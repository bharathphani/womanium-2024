<h> <b> Project tasks/ Deliverables < b /><h /> <br />
Pennylane - Task1.pdf : This pdf explains our understanding of pennylane through "Intoduction to Quantum Computing", "Single Qubit Gates", "Circuits with many bits" <br />
Pennylane - Task2.pdf : This pdf explains our understanding of Varitaional classifier and implemention of variational classifier for Parity function. <br />
Pennylane - task3.pdf : This pdf explains our understanding of QNN and implementation of QNN for minist dataset <br />
Pennylane - task4.pdf : This pdf explains how we implemented learning sin wave between 0, 2*pi <br /> <br />

pennylane_task2.ipynb : This notebook implemeted varational classifier for parity function. <br />
pennylane_task3.ipynb : This notebook implemeted QNN for minist dataset. <br />
pennylane_task3.ipynb : This notebook implemeted learning sinwave between 0, 2*pi. <br /> <br />

Rest are data files <br /> <br />

For QNN  <br />
Set SAVE_PATH parameter to point right locatio where ever we are running the file. <br />
